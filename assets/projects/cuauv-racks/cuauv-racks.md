*Made for CUAUV's '24-'25 submarine*
CUAUV is a completely student run project team that builds an autonomous underwater vehicle every year in order to compete in Robosub's annual event in San Diego. As a mechanical subteam member, I was tasked with building the mounting system for all of our custom PCBs and other electronics.
Features include:
- Laser cut acrylic backplane
- Central mounting / cooling tower verified by CFD simulations
- Colaboration with electrical teams to reduce length of cable routing
