## Overview
Our team designed, optimized, and tested a three-bladed small-scale wind turbine for a low-speed wind tunnel environment. The objective was to maximize power extraction while staying within geometric, structural, and operational constraints: blade radius under 6", chord depth under 2", and torque brake limits of 0.035 N·m at 3500 RPM max. The turbine was designed around a Weibull wind distribution (k=5, c=5) with a mean speed of 4.78 m/s. We targeted a tip speed ratio of 5, which literature suggests is optimal for three-blade configurations, and aimed for efficiency approaching the Betz limit (~60%).
## Design Process
We started by evaluating six high-lift airfoils and selected the **e216** for its superior lift-to-drag ratio at our expected Reynolds numbers (27,600–43,000) and a surface roughness factor of Ncrit = 9 to account for 3D printing layer lines. From there, we ran a parameter sweep over base chord lengths and taper ratios. For each configuration, we modeled lift, drag, and torque contributions along the blade span at the maximum expected wind speed (μ + 3σ = 7.75 m/s), then solved for the equilibrium rotation rate. Configurations exceeding structural or RPM limits were discarded. We settled on a **base chord of 0.08 m with a taper ratio of 0.5**, which balanced power extraction with structural margin. Pitch twist was computed to align each blade section's angle of attack with the e216's efficiency peak across the span.
## Testing
We tested across wind speeds spanning ±3σ of the Weibull distribution. At each speed, we swept the torque brake voltage in 0.3V increments, recording steady-state RPM and computing extracted power via P = ωτ. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of performance:
**Cₚ = P_extracted / P_available**
The turbine achieved peak efficiency near TSR ≈ 5 as intended. Power scaled with the expected near-cubic relationship to wind speed. We also observed an unexpected resonance region around 2200 RPM, which introduced audible vibration and a visible dip in efficiency.
## My Contribution
I handled CAD modeling for the blade geometry: translating our airfoil selection, pitch twist, and taper distribution into a printable design that satisfied the geometric constraints. After testing, I led the data analysis effort: processing the raw torque and RPM measurements, generating the performance curves (Power vs. RPM, Cₚ vs. TSR), and identifying the resonance behavior around 2200 RPM.
## Takeaways
The design validated our core aerodynamic decisions: the e216 airfoil, TSR = 5, and our chord/taper selection all performed as modeled. For a second iteration, we'd reduce pitch angle to improve low-speed startup behavior and shift the taper distribution to better align peak efficiency with the distribution mean rather than the high-speed tail.
