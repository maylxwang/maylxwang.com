*Made for MAE 2250: Mechanical Synthesis*
For my original design project, I decided to create a food processor that used a continuous servo and exacto-knife blade. The main diffrentiating factor was how our design could accomidate fruits and vegtables with different bends in them, by swapping out the twist-lock tube on the top of the slicing compartment.
