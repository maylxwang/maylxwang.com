*Made for Frank's plant biology lab under partnership with CROPPS*
This device was made to automate the tedious lab work of placing tissue samples within differing concentrations of solvents. For example, in order to preserve plant tissue, most water within the cells must be replaced with ethanol. However, immediately shocking the tissue sample leads to cell wall destruction, requiring scientists to gradually increase the concentration of ethanol. This Arduino Mega based device helps automate this process using peristaltic pumps and ball valves.
Features include:
- Programming concentrations and durations using the keypad and display
- Built in calibration sequence that guaranteed concentrations to within 0.5%
- Live data display and accidental shutoff protection
- Internal voltage converters to provide 3.3, 5, and 12V
